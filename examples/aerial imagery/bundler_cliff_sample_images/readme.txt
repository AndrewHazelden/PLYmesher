This ZIP archive includes three sample aerial photos of an oceanside cliff.

The aerial photos were taken from a Multiplex EasyStar model airplane over Polly Cove in West Dover, Nova Scotia, Canada. To capture the images I used a Canon Powershot SD780IS camera with the CHDK firmware and the Countdown Intervalometer script. 

The aerial photos are provided as free samples to test your installation of the Bundler Photogrammetry software.

The folder "full_resolution_images" contains the original 4000x3000 pixel images. The folder "scaled_images" contains images that are at a resolution of 2048x1536 pixels.
